### About Me :

- 📚 I am a senior at Rice University (graduating May 2025) majoring in computer science with a minor in data science

- 🧠 Passionate about AI and deep learning model interpretability, using models not just for functional purposes, but as tools to explore how humans process information subconsciously. 

- 🔎 Currently pursuing computer vision research under Professor Guha Balakrishnan at Rice University 

- 💼 Seeking full-time roles after my graduation in May 2025!

- 📡 Previous 2x SWE intern at Verizon (Summer 2023, Summer 2024)

- 😁 Fun facts: I enjoy rock climbing, playing Mahjong, and being involved in my University Student Government!

- 💻 Learn more on my website! (coming soon...)
